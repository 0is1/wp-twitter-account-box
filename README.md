## Roadmap towards version 1.0
This plugin works already. But there's still things TODO:
* Add the possibility to show tweets as well
* Enable Twitter authentication as default (maybe Premium?)
* Figure out if it's possible to check if user already follows the account and show "Following"-button instead of "Follow"-button
  * Maybe [GET friendships/exists](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/friendships/exists)
* Enable shortcodes
* Style admin panel options-page
* Make TAB more responsive
* Better error handling
* Documentation
* Test with different WP-versions
