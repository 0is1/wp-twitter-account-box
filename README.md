## Work in progress... but it's working!

* Like this:
* ![Image](public/images/twitteraccountbox-example.png?raw=true)

This plugin works already. But there's still things TODO:
* Figure out if it's possible to check if user already follows the account and show "Following"-button instead of "Follow"-button
  * Maybe [GET friendships/exists](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/friendships/exists)
* Enable shortcodes
* Style admin panel options-page
* Make TAB more responsive when it's included in small containers
* Better error handling
* Documentation
* Test with different WP-versions
